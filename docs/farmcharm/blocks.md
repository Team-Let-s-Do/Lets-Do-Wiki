# Blocks

## Stove
<BlockIcon modId="farmcharm" imageId="stove.png" description="The Stove is your primary crafting station for making pastries and bread. It also serves as a heat source for the Cooking Pot and Roaster." pixelated="false" />

### Usage
The block works similarly to other crafting stations in Minecraft: It has 3 input slots for ingredients (top left), one input slot for a fuel source (bottom left), and one output slot (middle right). It also offers a built-in [recipe book](common.md#recipe-book) that displays all available recipes and the ingredients required.

Once you've placed the ingredients needed for the recipe into the corresponding input slots, it takes about 12 seconds for the crafting process to complete. Crafting items requires a fuel source, such as coal or charcoal.

Processing time varies based on the material type, and holding an additional item in hand can reduce processing time.
