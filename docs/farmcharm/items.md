... of course, all the crops, fruits, and berries must have a use: food!

Farm & Charm offers over 30 delicious meals - there's something for everyone: from hearty soups to sweet pancakes, crispy bread, and tasty meats.

Each meal has different saturation and hunger values and provides various effects. Many of the meals can also be placed.
