Depending on the type of crop, they spawn with varying frequency. While you'll easily find some of these, you may need to take a little trip into the wilderness for others.

The respective wild crops are the perfect source to easily obtain the respective seeds and grains.

## Carts
<Icon modId="farmcharm" imageId="supply_cart.png" description="Carts are a perfect addition to simplify farming." type="misc" />

Currently, there are two different carts with various uses:

**Supply Cart**  
Can transport up to 2 players as well as plenty of items and blocks. It can also be used to quickly harvest larger fields: Simply drag the cart over mature crops. The respective drops will then land directly in the cart's chest.

**Plow**  
Ideal for creating larger areas of farmland. Drag the cart over grass blocks for this purpose - they will then be converted into farmland.

<br>

### Usage

Press (default) ``R`` to couple / pick up the cart.  
Press (default) ``G`` to open the chest.  
Right-click to sit on the cart.

:::note
Make sure you're targeting the cart.

The respective hotkeys can be changed in the control settings.
