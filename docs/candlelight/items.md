# Items
## Food

Food is mainly made in a [Cooking Pot](blocks.md#cooking-pot) or [Cooking Pan](blocks.md#cooking-pan).

If the food is prepared with a potion or wine in a Cooking Pot or Cooking Pan, the food item will receive the effect that was on the used potion or wine.

Most of the food from Candlelight is somewhat more expensive in terms of resources, but it can be eaten multiple times. Each time, the texture of the respective food item changes.

## Armor

... or at least dress like one. With just a bit of wool, leather, and thread, you can tailor this beautiful set for yourself. While it offers little in the way of armor value, it does protect you from minor burns (you receive Fire Resistance) and you’ll look great!

## Note Paper and Letter

You'll need either a writable notepaper or a [typewriter](blocks.md#typewriter) filled with notepaper.

### Usage
Write the letter and sign it. Now, while holding the envelope in your main hand, you can open it with a simple right-click. The GUI that opens has several slots: Two input slots (top left, bottom left) and an output slot (center right). Place the written letter and the opened envelope in the input slots, and you will get the sealed letter.

## Completionist Banner

**Note:** To receive the respective Advancements, you need all the items in your inventory at the same time.
