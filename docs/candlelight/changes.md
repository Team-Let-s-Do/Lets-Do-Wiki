# Changes

This section is designed to clarify the differences between the two Candlelight versions. This only pertains to the 1.20.1 versions.

Initially, it was merely the idea of a single mod focused on food processing. Gradually, more were added until it became a medium-sized series. Although there was always compatibility between the various mods, it never reached the extent where everything made sense and could truly grow togetherâ€”this is where the Farm&Charm Compat versions come in.

These versions require the [Let's Do] [Farm&Charm mod](/docs/farmcharm) as a dependency since it serves as the primary mod that introduces most of the [tools and ingredients](/docs/farmcharm/items.md), [crops](/docs/farmcharm/misc.md), and [food processing equipment](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md). This has allowed the elimination or specific modification of many redundant items and blocks.

:::note

If you want to continue Candlelight without the Farm&Charm support you can do this. I'll keep updating both of them until 1.21 releases - however, the non-compat Version won't get any new features.

**You can find the old Wiki in the [Legacy](/docs/Legacy/intro) version**

## Changes for Candlelight

Notable differences introduced in the Candlelight Compat version include:

* [**Tool Rack**](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md#tool-rack): The Tool Rack has been relocated to Farm&Charm!

* **Tomatoes**: Will grow into tall bushes now - they can be stabilized by using Ropes from Brewery.

* **New Items, Blocks and Effects**: Various new items have been added, including a Dinner Bell, Gloche, a lot of new Food and some nice looking Armor for special occasions.

* **Reworked Recipes**: Most Food Items have a different way of processing now - use a Mincer, Oven or Cooking Pot to craft them.

* **Textures**: Alright - that's just a small one. But most Textures got overhauled and slightly improved.

These enhancements streamline the gameplay experience, reduce item duplication, and enrich the thematic consistency of the mod series, while also facilitating a more integrated and cohesive mod environment.

Thank you for playing my mods! I hope this section can clear up some confusion, and I hope you have as much fun playing them as I did develop them. You are awesome! ðŸ¥‡
