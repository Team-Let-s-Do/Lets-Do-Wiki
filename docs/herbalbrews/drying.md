# Drying
## Drying Blocks
<BlockIcon modId="herbalbrews" imageId="tea_block.png" description="To obtain dried green, black, or oolong tea, you must process various ingredients into a block and dry it in the light. The drying process takes about one minute." />

### Example
For dried green tea, you need 9 tea leaves. Combine these into a block, wait for the drying time, destroy the block, and receive dried green tea. You can then use this to make a green tea block to process it further into black tea or use it directly for a wide selection of tea.
