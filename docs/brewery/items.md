# Items
## Food
<ItemIcon modId="brewery" imageId="pretzel.png" description="What would the Brewfest be without food? There is a variety of food inspired by the Bavarian Oktoberfest. Most of it can be easily made in the Smoker. For others, one must get a bit more creative." />

Want to slice your chicken? Throw it on a Stonecutter!
Need Mashed Potatoes? Toss them on a Stonecutter as well!

## Armor
<ItemIcon modId="brewery" imageId="brewfest_hat.png" description="And of course, everyone attending the Brewfest should be properly dressed. The corresponding clothing can be obtained from a Bartender Villager. This villager uses a Barblock as a workstation." />

The piece of clothing he sells is random, so you might well need to visit several traders to get the complete set.

As a reward for wearing the full set, you become immune to the effects of alcohol. Woohoo!

## Completionist Banner
<ItemIcon modId="brewery" imageId="beer_standard.png" description="The Completionist Banner is awarded to all players who have crafted all Beverages from the Brewery Mod." />

**Note:** To receive the respective Advancements, you need all the items in your inventory at the same time.

Thank you for playing Brewery! ❤️
