# Changes

This section is designed to clarify the differences between the two Brewery versions. This only pertains to the 1.20.1 versions.

Initially, it was merely the idea of a single mod focused on food processing. Gradually, more were added until it became a medium-sized series. Although there was always compatibility between the various mods, it never reached the extent where everything made sense and could truly grow togetherâ€”this is where the Farm&Charm Compat versions come in.

These versions require the [Let's Do] [Farm&Charm mod](/docs/farmcharm) as a dependency since it serves as the primary mod that introduces most of the [tools and ingredients](/docs/farmcharm/items.md), [crops](/docs/farmcharm/misc.md), and [food processing equipment](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md). This has allowed the elimination or specific modification of many redundant items and blocks.

:::note

If you want to continue Brewery without the Farm&Charm support you can do this. I'll keep updating both of them until 1.21 releases - however, the non-compat Version won't get any new features.
You can find the old Wiki in the [Legacy](/docs/Legacy/intro) version

## Changes for Brewery

Notable differences introduced in the Brewery Compat version include:

* [**Silo**](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md#silo): The Silo has been relocated to Farm&Charm, where it now serves an expanded purpose. More Drying Recipes included!

* [**Ropes**](blocks#rope): Ropes can now also be used to stabilize Tomatoes from Candlelight.

* **New Items, Blocks and Effects**: Various new items have been added, including Whiskey, Vodka, more Beer and a special Beer with unforeseen consequences. Also, more Effects for the new Beer Variants - most of them with an offensive use.

* **Reworked Recipes**: Most Food Items have a different way of processing now - use a [Mincer](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md#mincer), [Stove](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md#stove) or [Cooking Pot](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md#cooking-pot) to craft them.

* **Tables**: Alright - that's just a small one. But tables don't have any table cloth in it anymore when crafted. In order to get your table cloth back you can simply use a Patterned Carpet on it.

These enhancements streamline the gameplay experience, reduce item duplication, and enrich the thematic consistency of the mod series, while also facilitating a more integrated and cohesive mod environment.
