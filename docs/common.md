# Common

Some things are common trough all of the Let‘s do mods:

## Recipe Book

Almost every crafting station like block, has a recipe book, similar to the vanilla one. If it doesn‘t show up, it could be removed trough a mod like FastWorkBench. Also JEI and REI have a option to disable it.


## Config

Some of our mods have a config where you can configure your mod experience.
You can edit it in the file normally located in <minecraft instance folder>/config/<modid>/.
You can also edit it in-game. But for some options you may have to restart your game for them to apply. To access the config in game you have to install [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and on Fabric also [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).

## REI JEI EMI Support
