## Pells
My research has shown that these things are called Pells. Sounds strange, but it's true – or maybe I just did poor research. Anyway:

These cute-looking things can be used to test how much damage you deal. Other players can see this too. Ideal to show who’s the best... Well, you get it.

The Pells are animated and (theoretically) indestructible.

Shift right-click to pick it up again.
