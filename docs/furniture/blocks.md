# Blocks

## Fish Tank
<BlockIcon modId="furniture" imageId="copper_fish_tank.png" description="Similar to a bed, it requires two blocks and can be filled with fish from buckets. Each fish species can be added once." />
Currently, the Fish Tank can be filled with Cod, Salmon, and Pufferfish.

The fish are animated and super cute!

***

## Bin
<BlockIcon modId="furniture" imageId="bin.png" description="Everyone collects something they no longer need at some point. Or receives gifts that aren't so great after all. The Bin is perfect for this!" />
Hold the item in your main hand and perform a gentle right-click while targeting the Bin, and the item will be deleted. Irrevocably. It's gone. Forever.

When the Bin is full, there is a chance that a Trash Bag will drop.

From Trash Bags, you can theoretically get any item from any mod.

Want to prevent something from dropping? Use the trash_bag_blacklist tag.
