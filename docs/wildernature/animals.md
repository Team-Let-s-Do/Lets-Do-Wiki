# Animals

## Deer
Deers now populate your forested areas and are an ideal source of food, usually spawning in smaller groups.

The biomes in which Deer spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_deer` tag.

Upon death, deer usually drop 1-2 venison and occasionally some leather.

Deer are quite shy and will run away in fear if they see or smell a player. From time to time, deer will sniff the air and seek cover if they detect a player, villager, or illager nearby.

:::note
If you approach them carefully, they should be less skittish.

## Bison
Bison spawn in larger groups in savanna biomes. They do not like players and will attack in groups if a player approaches. Despite their enormous size, they cause only a small amount of damage but have a very strong knockback.

The biomes in which Bisons spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_bison` tag.

Upon death, bison usually drop 2-3 bison meat and occasionally a lot of leather.

## Boar
Boars, if enabled in the config, replace pigs in forest and savanna areas. They appear in small groups and are peaceful.

The biomes in which Boars spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_boar` tag.

From time to time, they roam around, search the ground, and can find various items: roots, coarse dirt, or even truffles!

Boars have the same loot table as pigs.

## Cassowary
Oh no! These are nasty little beasts. They primarily inhabit savannas and are not only extremely loud and aggressive but also appear in larger groups and hunt players together.

The biomes in which Cassowaries spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_cassowary` tag.

Sharp claws, high damage! They can penetrate even the strongest armor.

Upon death, they drop plenty of feathers and cassowary meat—not tasty.

## Flamingo
What a bird! Finally, I can make enough arrows... um, yes.

The biomes in which Flamingos spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_flamingo` tag.

Flamingos populate beach biomes. They don't do much, but they drop feathers, lots of feathers, and are very colorful.

***

## Dog
Oh my God! Is that a real dog? Yes! Dogs can be found either in villages or plains biomes—usually alone, rarely in pairs.

Dogs are neutral and do not disturb or harass anyone. Not even zombies or skeletons... although, if they see a cat, a wild chase begins!

Upon death, dogs drop bones. You monster!

## Hedgehog
Look how cute he is!

He can be found in forests. Please don't feed him milk. Unfortunately, he has poor eyesight and occasionally runs into blocks or other obstacles.

The biomes in which Hedgehogs spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_hedgehog` tag.

What does he drop? Why would you want to kill him? He drops nothing.

## Minisheep
OMG! Another fluffy creature! Perfectly suited for colder regions and can therefore be found in mountainous areas.

The biomes in which Minisheep spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_minisheep` tag.

It can be sheared for wool. Lots of wool. And upon death, it drops even more wool... and Mutton. Wow.

## Owl
Hunter of the night. Preferably found in forests. Sleeps during the day, hunts at night.

The biomes in which Owls spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_owl` tag.

Can be tamed with rotten flesh and carried on the shoulders. Theoretically—I've honestly never tested it. Owls target most other critters and fight them - you can change the targets by altering the `wildernature:owl_targets` tag.

<Image modId="wildernature" imageId="owl.png" align="center" />

***

## Pelican
Ah, I remember these things from Beachparty! Can be found in Beach Biomes.

The biomes in which Pelicans spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_pelican` tag.

They've received some new animations since then and... wow! You used to kill these defenseless creatures just like that? Now they fight back, strike back, and even call their friends for help. They're probably still not a real threat to you.

Upon death, they drop feathers and pelican meat.

## Turkey
Same as Pelicans.

The biomes in which Turkeys spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_turkey` tag.

Upon death, they drop feathers and turkey meat.

<Image modId="wildernature" imageId="turkey.png" align="center" />

## Penguin
A real pirate. Why? More on that later. Found in icy biomes.

The biomes in which Penguins spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_penguin` tag.

By the way, I didn't vote for the penguin back then. Nevertheless, here he is. Penguins love boats, especially yours. If they see a boat nearby, they'll hop in and take off. However, their driving skills aren't the best. What else do they do? They increase the speed of the boat they're in (even if you're driving) by 10% and are otherwise just decorative.

## Raccoon
Raccoons can be found just about everywhere.

The biomes in which Raccoons spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_raccoon` tag.

They like to sneak into villages and roam around. Raccoons can open doors. No, they cannot be tamed.

Upon death, they have a chance to drop a loot bag containing food or other items.

## Red Wolf
Improved wolves. They still do almost the same things—just with more animations.

The biomes in which Red Wolfs spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_red_wolf` tag.

When they spot their prey, they sneak up and initially deal more damage.

<Image modId="wildernature" imageId="red_wolf.png" align="center" />

***

## Squirrel
Oh, so cute. They love eating nuts, stealing saplings, and running around. That's it.

The biomes in which Squirrels spawn can be changed in the `wildernature:spawns_squirrel` tag.
