# Items
## Collectibles
Of course, there are also some items that can be collected as collectibles by completing bounties.

However, I don't want to list them all here, just the most important ones with special functions.

### Fur Cloak
<ItemIcon modId="wildernature" imageId="fur_cloak.png" description="Available by completing certain bounties." />
Creepers fear you and run away in panic (mostly at least!) when you wear this cloak.

## Completionist Banner
<ItemIcon modId="wildernature" imageId="blunderbuss.png" description="Available by completing certain bounties." />
A Thunderbluss. Loud! Requires ammunition. Sets hit enemies on fire. Short reload time, medium range, incredibly inaccurate.
