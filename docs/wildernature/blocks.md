## Bounty Board
I wouldn't claim this is a main feature. More of a small gimmick to earn experience and some collectibles.

The Bounty Board can be easily crafted from basic materials. Right-click to open the GUI and you will see a selection of three different bounties offered, usually with varying targets. Accept a bounty and get started!

After completing the bounty, you can return to the Bounty Board, turn in the quest, and receive your rewards.

The Bounty Board has multiple levels. Each completed quest not only gives you experience points but also levels up the Bounty Board. The higher the level, the more challenging and better-rewarded the quests become.

If you're not interested in any of the bounties, you can reroll the quests up to 3 times every 15 minutes by pressing the button in the top left corner.

## Hazelnut Bush
Bushes. Hazelnut bushes. They drop hazelnuts.

They function exactly like sweet berry bushes and can mainly be found in plains biomes.

## Collectibles
Rewards for completed bounties.

Usable as decoration. There are obviously more than just these!
