# Blocks
## Cheese Press
<BlockIcon modId="meadow" imageId="cheese_press.png" description="The Cheese Press is your primary crafting station for making cheese." />

### Usage

The block has two input slots: One will usually be used for rennet, the other one for milk.

Once you've placed the ingredients needed for the respective recipe into the corresponding input slots, it takes around a minute for the pressing process to complete - the crafted cheese wheel then appears in the output slot.

Depending on which type of milk you use, the produced cheese is different. There are 7 types of cheese. It also offers a built-in recipe book that displays all available recipes and the ingredients required for them.

Note: The cheese wheel located in the output slot is also displayed within the block in the game world.
