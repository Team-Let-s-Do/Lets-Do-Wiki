# Changes

This section is designed to clarify the differences between the two Bakery versions. This only pertains to the 1.20.1 versions.

Initially, it was merely the idea of a single mod focused on food processing. Gradually, more were added until it became a medium-sized series. Although there was always compatibility between the various mods, it never reached the extent where everything made sense and could truly grow togetherâ€”this is where the Farm&Charm Compat versions come in.

These versions require the [Let's Do] [Farm&Charm mod](/docs/farmcharm) as a dependency since it serves as the primary mod that introduces most of the [tools and ingredients](/docs/farmcharm/items.md), [crops](/docs/farmcharm/misc.md), and [food processing equipment](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md). This has allowed the elimination or specific modification of many redundant items and blocks.

:::note

If you want to continue Bakery without the Farm&Charm support you can do this. I'll keep updating both of them until 1.21 releases - however, the non-compat Version won't get any new features.

**You can find the old Wiki in the [Legacy](/docs/Legacy/intro) version**

## Changes for Bakery

Notable differences introduced in the Bakery Compat version include:

* [**Small Cooking Pot**](blocks.md#small-cooking-pot): Now capable of processing recipes from Candlelight, Farm&Charm, and Brewery. Although the pot is small, which speeds up the processing time, the output is consistently limited to one. You can also hang it on a [Tool Rack](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md#tool-rack) now.

* **Ovens**: All ovens and their variations have been removed. The Main [Oven](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md#stove) is now available in Farm&Charm, with variations found in Candlelight.

* [**Crafting Bowl**](/docs/farmcharm/blocks.md#crafting-bowl): The Crafting Bowl has been relocated to Farm&Charm, where it now serves an expanded purpose.

* **Recipe Changes**: Most recipes have been revised. Dough is now found in Farm&Charm. The majority of recipes now require ingredients such as Flour, Yeast, and/or Butter, which are introduced through Farm&Charm.

* **New Items**: Various new items have been added, including more sandwiches, Jam Bread, and cakes.

These enhancements streamline the gameplay experience, reduce item duplication, and enrich the thematic consistency of the mod series, while also facilitating a more integrated and cohesive mod environment.
