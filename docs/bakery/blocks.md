# Blocks

## Wild Crops
After successfully adding Bakery to your mods, you will be able to discover various new plant species in newly generated chunks. Some of these will be more common, while others will be rarer to find. So keep your eyes open!

:::info
Most of the [Crops](/docs/farmcharm/misc.md#worldgen) got moved to Farm&Charm.

### Oat (in F&C now)
<BlockIcon modId="bakery" imageId="oat_stage5_2.png" description="You can primarily find oat in Plains biomes in the form of a small farmland structure. There is also a chance to find it in various village structures as well as pillager outposts, woodland mansions, or in the small Bakery structure." />

### Strawberries (in F&C now)

## Small Cooking Pot
<BlockIcon modId="bakery" imageId="small_cooking_pot.png" description="The Caking Station is mainly used to prepare cakes, cupcakes, and cookies." />

### Usage
The Small Cooking Pot has 6 input slots for ingredients (top left), one container slot (middle), one output slot (middle right), and an indicator of whether it is on a hot (lit) surface. Like the Stove, it also offers a built-in [recipe book](common.md#recipe-book) that displays all available recipes and the ingredients required for them.

Once you've placed the ingredients needed for the respective recipe into the corresponding input slots, it takes about 30 seconds for the crafting process to complete - the crafted item then appears in the output slot. To make the small cooking pot usable, it must be on a hot surface. You can recognize this both audiovisually in the game through rising bubbles and cooking sounds, as well as visually in the GUI of the cooking pot: The fire changes from grayscale to colorful.

## Caking Station
<BlockIcon modId="bakery" imageId="caking_station.png" description="The Caking Station is mainly used to prepare cakes, cupcakes, and cookies." pixelated="false" />

### Usage
The block has no interface but functions solely through direct interaction. Certain items each lead to a different result.

The starting product to begin the manufacturing process is always a Cake Dough. Make sure your off-hand is free, and you hold the Cake Dough in your main hand - then click on the Caking Station to place raw cake batter.

Now you have the following options:

* Use Jam to make a cake 
* Use a knife to cut the raw cake batter and then process it into cupcakes with Jam 
* Use a knife first and then a Rolling Pin to cut and roll the raw cake batter and then process it into cookies with Jam 

Upon completion, you can dismantle and pick up the respective end product.

## Crafting Bowl
<BlockIcon modId="bakery" imageId="crafting_bowl.png" description="The Crafting Bowl is used to make various types of dough." />

### Usage
Like the Caking Station, the Crafting Bowl also has no interface and functions through direct interaction. The Crafting Bowl has a capacity of up to a maximum of 4 items.

Once you have placed the correct ingredients inside, you can stir the whisk in the bowl to start the dough-making process. This is visually represented with an animation.

:::info

You need an empty hand to start the manufacturing process.

## Cakes
<BlockIcon modId="bakery" imageId="strawberry_cake.png" description="Congratulations on your first cake!" />

### Usage
Cakes can be placed in the world and provide a way to decorate your builds.
* With a gentle right-click, you can pick up the cake again.
* Want to eat the cake in place? You can Shift-right-click to eat from a cake up to 4 times.
* Prefer to eat the cake on the go? Then cut it into up to 4 pieces with a knife.
