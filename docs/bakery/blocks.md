# Blocks

## Wild Crops
After successfully adding Bakery to your mods, you will be able to discover various new plant species in newly generated chunks. Some of these will be more common, while others will be rarer to find. So keep your eyes open!

**Note:** You will not be able to find crops in chunks that have already been generated.

### Oat

There is also a chance to find it in various village structures as well as pillager outposts, woodland mansions, or in the small Bakery structure." />

### Strawberries

Strawberries specifically spawn in the following biomes:
Plains Meadow Sunflower_plains River Taiga and all sub-variants Jungle and all sub-variants Savanna and all sub-variants

## Stove
<BlockIcon modId="bakery" imageId="stove.png" description="The Stove is your primary crafting station for making pastries and bread. It also serves as a heat source for the Cooking Pot." pixelated=false />

### Usage
The block works similarly to the already known crafting stations in Minecraft: It has 3 input slots for ingredients (top left), one input slot for a fuel source (bottom left), and one output slot (middle right). It also offers a built-in recipe book that displays all available recipes and the ingredients required for them.

Once you've placed the ingredients needed for the respective recipe into the corresponding input slots, it takes about 12 seconds for the crafting process to complete - the crafted item then appears in the output slot. Crafting all items requires a valid item in the fuel slot - this can be either coal, charcoal, or other items.

**Note:** The items located in both the output and input slots are also displayed within the block in the game world.

## Small Cooking Pot
<BlockIcon modId="bakery" imageId="small_cooking_pot.png" description="The Caking Station is mainly used to prepare cakes, cupcakes, and cookies." />

### Usage
The Small Cooking Pot has 6 input slots for ingredients (top left), one container slot (middle), one output slot (middle right), and an indicator of whether it is on a hot (lit) surface. Like the Stove, it also offers a built-in recipe book that displays all available recipes and the ingredients required for them.

Once you've placed the ingredients needed for the respective recipe into the corresponding input slots, it takes about 30 seconds for the crafting process to complete - the crafted item then appears in the output slot. To make the small cooking pot usable, it must be on a hot surface. You can recognize this both audiovisually in the game through rising bubbles and cooking sounds, as well as visually in the GUI of the cooking pot: The fire changes from grayscale to colorful.
