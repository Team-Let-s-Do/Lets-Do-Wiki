# Blocks
## Grapevine Pot
<BlockIcon modId="vinery" imageId="grapevine_pot.png" description="Required to process grapes into grape juice." pixelated="false" />
Fill the pot with the respective grapes until it is completely full, jump in and hop/move around in it until the grapes have turned into grape juice. Then, you can extract the freshly pressed grape juice with wine bottles.

:::info

You can't mix different Grape Variants.

## Fermentation Barrel
<BlockIcon modId="vinery" imageId="fermentation_barrel.png" description="The Fermentation Barrel is your primary crafting station for making Wine." />

### Usage
The block works similarly to the already known crafting stations in Minecraft: It has 4 input slots for ingredients (left), one input slot for a wine bottle (middle), and one output slot (right). It also offers a built-in [recipe book](common.md#recipe-book) that displays all available recipes and the ingredients required for them.

Once you've placed the ingredients needed for the respective recipe into the corresponding input slots, it takes about 12 seconds for the crafting process to complete - the crafted item then appears in the output slot.

Crafting Time can be changed in the config.

## Apple Press
<BlockIcon modId="vinery" imageId="apple_press.png" description="The Apple Press is a crafting station for making Apple Mash." />
Like the Fermentation Barrel, the Apple Press also resembles the crafting stations in Minecraft. The Apple Press only has 1 input slot for apples (top left) and one output slot (right).

Once you've placed the apples into the input slot, it takes a few seconds for the crafting process to complete - the Apple Mash then appears in the output slot.

:::tip

The Apple Press also acts as a workstation for Winemaker Villagers. (yeah idk why either)

## Lattice
<BlockIcon modId="vinery" imageId="lattice.png" description="A beautiful decoration for walls, passageways, etc., which can also be used to cultivate jungle grapes." />
The application is quite simple: Target the lattice and right-click to place your jungle grape seeds.

:::info

The lattice connects to the adjacent lattice to the right or left. If you're holding an axe and right-click on the lattice, you can toggle the supports on or off. It also offers two different placement options: on top of the block or on the side of another block.

## Wine Racks
<BlockIcon modId="vinery" imageId="wine_rack.png" description="Used to store wine. Come in diverse variations regarding wood type, size, and arrangement." />

:::note

Not every wine fits in the small or large wine racks. But every wine fits in the standard wine rack.
