After successfully adding NetherVinery to your mods, you will be able to discover various new plant species in newly generated chunks. Some of these will be more common, while others will be rarer to find. So keep your eyes open!

**Note:** You will not be able to find crops in chunks that have already been generated.

**Crimson Grape Bush**

You can primarily find wild Crimson Grape Bushes in crimson Forest biomes. There is also a chance to find it in various nether structures. They only spawn near Lava Lakes.

**Warped Grape Bush**

You can primarily find wild Warped Grape Bushes in warped Forest biomes. There is also a chance to find it in various nether structures. They only spawn near Lava Lakes.

Used to cultivate normal, taiga, savanna, warped and crimson grapes.


The Stem is two blocks high, and to place the respective seeds, you must (while holding the seeds) click on the upper part. Increased Growth Speed by 10%

You are immortal! At least for a short moment. Is it worth it for the Netherite Ingot?
