# Miscellaneous
## World Generation

<Icon modId="vinery" imageId="apple_tree_sapling.png" description="After successfully adding Vinery to your mods, you will be able to discover various new plant species in newly generated chunks. Some of these will be more common, while others will be rarer to find. So keep your eyes open!" type="misc" />

### Apple and Cherry Trees
Apple and Cherry Trees spawning in temperate Biomes such as Plains, Meadow and Sunflower Plains. They look similar to Oak Trees but some Leaves have visible red Fruits on it - to harvest them, make sure your main hand is empty. Then you can (while targeting the Leaves Block with visible Fruits) right-click and you'll get a freshly picked Fruits!

:::tip

There is a marginal chance that you will get a rotten cherry. Ugh - please don't eat that! Maybe you can throw it at undesirable creatures (or friends)?
