# Items
## Armor
<ItemIcon modId="vinery" imageId="straw_hat_item.png" description="Perfect for grape cultivation: The Winemaker Armor Set." />
When you wear all four pieces of the set, you receive a set bonus. This bonus prevents the bone meal you use from being consumed - however, the armor set loses durability in exchange.

:::info

In the [config](common.md#config), you can adjust how much durability the set loses. Additionally, you can toggle the effect of the set on or off and more!
